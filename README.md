## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Frontend:**  
  - Users land on `index.html` and enter a room number.
  - They are redirected to `/chat/{roomId}`.
  - The chat UI connects to the backend via WebSocket and subscribes to messages for that room.
  - Messages are sent and received in real time.

- **Backend:**  
  - Spring Boot serves the HTML pages and handles WebSocket connections.
  - Messages sent to `/app/sendmessage/{roomId}` are broadcast to `/topic/messages/{roomId}`.
  - Each room is isolated by its unique room number.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+ (or your configured version)
- Maven or Gradle

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### Build the Project

**With Maven:**
```sh
mvn clean package
```
**With Gradle:**
```sh
./gradlew build
```

### Run the Application

```sh
java -jar target/app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
or (if using Gradle):
```sh
java -jar build/libs/app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The app will start on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) by default.

---

## üåê Usage

1. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
2. Enter a room number and join.
3. Enter your username (if prompted).
4. Start chatting! Share the room link with friends to chat together.

## ‚ö° Deployment

You can deploy this app on any Java-supporting server or cloud platform (AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, Render, Railway, etc.).

### Change the Port

Edit `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
```
server.port=2116
```

### Production Tips

- Use HTTPS for secure WebSocket connections.
- Set allowed origins in `WebSocketConfig.java` for security.
- Use a reverse proxy (like Nginx) for SSL and load balancing.

---

## üß© Customization

- **UI:** Edit `chat.html` and `index.html` in `src/main/resources/templates/`.
- **Backend logic:** Add features in `ChatController.java` or create new controllers/services.
- **Persistence:** Integrate a database for message history if needed.

## üôã FAQ

**Q: Can I deploy this on Vercel?**  
A: No, Vercel does not support Java backends. Use platforms like Render, Railway, or your own VPS.

**Q: How do I add authentication?**  
A: Integrate Spring Security and add login logic in the backend and frontend.

**Q: Can I use this with React or another frontend?**  
A: Yes! Just connect your frontend to the WebSocket endpoints.
